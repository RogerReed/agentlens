# Changelog

All notable changes to AgentLens are documented here.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- README overhauled — restructured around a local/transparency theme; Getting Started split into VS Code Extension and Standalone (Docker) subsections with ephemeral and persistent Docker commands; Configuration reorganized with Manual Configuration first followed by Auto-configuration; Replaying Exported Spans promoted to its own top-level section; section headers simplified throughout
- Removed unused setting from VS Code extension settings contributions

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Export tab** — new dashboard tab (between Errors and Help) with Export Raw and Export Redacted buttons, 3-second confirmation state, and inline replay instructions
- **Export Redacted** — `AgentLens: Export OTEL Data (Redacted)` command; prompt text, tool inputs/results, and PII fields (`user.*`, `enduser.*`, `organization.*`) replaced with `[redacted]`; files named `export_redacted_*`
- **Replay from exported file** — `pnpm run demo -- --file <path>` replays any exported JSON (raw or redacted) directly into the dashboard; instant send by default, `--speed N` for paced replay; works with both plugin and standalone on port 4318
- **Sidebar latest session card** — model, source, turns, tool calls, errors, and cache hit rate for the most recent session
- **Sidebar expand/collapse** — ◄/► toggle to show or hide the AgentLens sidebar panel; dashboard opens automatically on first activation

### Changed

- Recommendations action buttons unified to "Copy for {Agent}" / "Copy to Clipboard" (removed "Ask Claude / Ask Copilot / Ask Codex" labels)
- Standalone export now downloads a ZIP archive; plugin export writes JSON files to workspace root

### Fixed

- Export `message` event listener was registered inside the tooltip `useEffect` without cleanup — moved to its own `useEffect` with proper removal on unmount

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- Port conflict detection now distinguishes between another AgentLens VS Code window (silent fallback with cross-window sync), the AgentLens standalone server (error with specific message), and an unrelated process (error with instruction to change `agentLens.otlpPort`)
- Plugin and standalone servers now expose fingerprint endpoints (`/agentlens/plugin` and `/agentlens/standalone`) so each can identify the other

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- Built-in OTLP/HTTP collector on `127.0.0.1:4318` — JSON-over-HTTP only (protobuf not required)
- Auto-configuration for GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex on activation
- 15-tab dashboard: Efficiency, Recommendations, Alerts, Automation, Summaries, Traces, Files, Agents, Tokens, Latency, Flow, Tools, Errors, Export, Help
- Loop and malfunction detection — Tool Call Deadlock, State Corruption Spiral, Hallucination Amplification Loop, Escalating Scope, Context Accumulation
- Conversation grouping — Copilot and Codex sessions linked by their conversation thread ID
- Per-session Conversation column in Efficiency tab
- Standalone web server mode (`pnpm run standalone`) and Docker image (`agentlens/agentlens`)
- Write Prompts File automation — writes triggered prompts to `agentlens-prompts-{agent}.md` in workspace or server directory
- Automation recency guard — only sessions active within the last 2 minutes trigger automations
- Per-agent threshold profiles for Alerts and Automation tabs
- Export tab — export raw or redacted span data as JSON directly from the dashboard; includes replay instructions
- Export OTEL Data command — writes raw span data as JSON files (Command Palette: `AgentLens: Export OTEL Data`)
- Export OTEL Data (Redacted) command — same export with prompt text, tool inputs/results, and PII fields replaced with `[redacted]` (Command Palette: `AgentLens: Export OTEL Data (Redacted)`)
- Collector error banner in sidebar when OTLP port is already in use
